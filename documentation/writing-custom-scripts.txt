The landscape is rendered by two seperate processes:

1. Shape generation:
This process decides what overall shape the landscape will have.
For documentation on shape generation, see documentation/shape-scripts.txt.

2. Coloring:
This process decides how the generated shape will be colored.
For documentation on coloring, see documentation/coloring-scripts.txt.
